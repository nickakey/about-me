<p>Language learning requires sacrifice.</p>

<p>You’re sacrificing time, energy, and willpower.</p>

<p>This means language learning has to be budgeted for, within ALL the other things that demand your resources. (Work, other goals / hobbies, family)</p>

<p>Frankly, this sucks.</p>

<p>What if we could spend more time learning -</p>

<p>WITHOUT spending any extra time, energy, or willpower?</p>

<p><strong>In this article, I’ll share 3 techniques to do just that.</strong></p>

<p>These techniques are based on 2 things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first two techniques are based on <strong>“habit hijacking”</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>This is when you slightly modify an existing habit to derive a new benefit from it. Since you’re leveraging an EXISTING habit, it requires no extra willpower, energy, or time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The last technique uses <strong>“the minimal habit”</strong> approach -
    <ul>
      <li>Here, you are technically starting a new habit, but we’re making the initial commitment SO EASY, that building and following the habit are effortless.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-target-language-memes">#1: Target language memes</h3>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of scrolling Instagram for memes, this trick is for you!</p>

<p>Find meme accounts in your target language, follow a few of them - now every time you scroll Instagram, you will naturally see some content in your target language.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t fully understand the memes yet, even just the slow and constant exposure to the few words you know makes a big difference.</p>

<p>Over a week of memeing, this could add up to hundreds or thousands of target language sentences read or skimmed.</p>

<p>That’s a great deal for something that requires 0 effort!</p>

<p><strong>BONUS TIP:</strong> To find meme accounts in your target language, Google the phrase “best meme accounts” - but do so in your TARGET language. For Spanish memes I searched “Mejores cuentas de memes”</p>

<p>Here are some of my favorite Spanish meme accounts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/cripsregios/">@cripsregios</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/la_memensa/?hl=en">@la_memensa</a></li>

</ul>

<p>If you like to watch series or movies at home, this trick is for you!</p>

<p>Next time you’re watching something, use the normal English audio, but turn on the subtitles to your TARGET language.</p>

<p>In the case of Spanish, this means watching a movie with ENGLISH audio, but SPANISH subtitles.</p>

<p>Without even trying, your eyes will naturally skim the target language subtitles and a few cool things will happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You will see words you already know, and you will willl naturally remember and reinforce their definition</li>
  <li>You will see words you don’t know, but will infer the definition.
    <ul>
      <li>Imagine a movie about a giant shark where the word <strong>tiburón</strong> keeps showing up in the subtitles. Now imagine there is a scene where the main character loudly yells SHAAAARRRKKK, and the subtitles read <strong>tiburón!!!</strong>. Without even trying , somewhere in the back of your mind you are noticing a link between “shark” and “tiburón”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you watch 5 hours of Netflix a week, this can add up to thousands of target language sentences read or skimmed.</p>

<p><strong>BONUS TIP:</strong> Sometimes this works with group viewing! If you are watching with a partner or friends, they often won’t mind if there are extra subtitles on the bottom of the screen they don’t understand. It’s worth asking!</p>

<p>If you live with someone who supports your language learning, this one is for you!</p>

<p>Choose ONE object in your house, commit to ONLY calling that the target language word.</p>

<p>For example, imagine calling a mug “taza”</p>

<p>From now on, when you are home you just <strong><em>never</em></strong> say mug. You always say taza.</p>

<p>This is ESPECIALLY powerful if someone you live with also commits to calling it that word.</p>

<p>This should be trivially easy for most, and is guaranteed to BURN the word into your mind.</p>

<p>Do that for a couple weeks, until it’s second nature - then choose a new object!</p>

<p><em>(The key thing here is that it should always feel easy. Doing more than one word at a time will feel like work)</em></p>
