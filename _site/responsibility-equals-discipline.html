<p><strong>TL:DR: When you add more external responsibility you have in your life, you magically attain more discipline and determination</strong></p>

<p>As a teen, I pursed lofty goals.</p>

<p>Goals that depended on putting in consistent work over a long period of time.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Become an internet marketer = spend 40 hours a week on trying to make $1 online. Do this for 3 months.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build cool personal projects = spend 10 hours every weekend on development. Do this for 12 months.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately - from the ages 15 - 18 I found doing the above <strong>impossible</strong>.</p>

<p>I simply didn’t have the discipline to stick to these commitments - even though I KNEW the reward would be great.</p>

<p>I read books, I listened to podcasts, I tried cold showers…</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, I just didn’t have the discipline.</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve seen the same issue come up in other precocious teens.</p>

<p>They have ambition, but <strong>rarely</strong> actually do the hard things required.</p>

<p>So what changed for me?</p>

<p>What was the secret sauce that gave me this discipline?</p>

<p><strong>Responsibility.</strong></p>

<p>When I started working real jobs, with REAL consequences, I found I <strong><em>magically</em></strong> had discipline.</p>

<p>If I knew that my boss was going to be disappointed with me,</p>

<p>or that other people were relying on me,</p>

<p>or that my career might be at stake ,</p>

<p>I SUDDENLY found I had <strong><em>wells</em></strong> of discipline to pull from.</p>

<p>I could work long days, I could push through resistance, I could stick to tough things.</p>

<p><strong>And here’s the surprising part:</strong></p>

<p>That discipline started to spread to other areas of my life;</p>

<p>EVEN if there was no boss to be dissapointed with me, and no coworkers relying on me.</p>

<p>By “learning” what being disciplined felt like, I was able to use it more and more on my personal projects.</p>

<p>The more responsibility I took on, the more discipline I gained.</p>
