      <p>While making new friends, you will DEFINITELY run into this puzzle.</p>

<p>While the puzzle is easy to understand, I don’t think there is any “easy” solution.</p>

<p>To start, let’s look at two strategies that must be employed while making new friends.</p>

<h2 id="the-two-strategies">THE TWO STRATEGIES:</h2>

<h3 id="1-commitment">1: Commitment:</h3>

<p>Social bonds are formed by sharing experiences over a long period of time.</p>

<p>This means, you need to COMMIT to building social bonds, BEFORE you have social bonds.</p>

<p>That might look like going to a group activity 10 times <strong>before</strong> you start to feel “connected” with the members.</p>

<h3 id="2-pickiness">2: Pickiness:</h3>

<p>Since you are the AVERAGE of the 5 people you spend time with, you need to be careful who you spend time with.</p>

<p>If you discover that someone is not aligned with your values / goals / lifestyle, you should <strong>quickly</strong> move onto new potential friends. Waste no time.</p>

<h2 id="the-puzzle">The PUZZLE:</h2>

<h4 id="consider-bob">Consider Bob:</h4>

<p>He seems nice enough at first meeting, but on the second meeting he rubs you the wrong way.</p>

<p>Should you <strong>commit</strong> more time to the relationship? (Maybe it was just a fluke bad encounter, and more time will reveal he is actually awesome)</p>

<p>Or should you be <strong>picky</strong> and move on to another potential friend? (After all, why waste that time!)</p>

<p>This is a puzzle!</p>

<p>Being too focused on <strong>commitment</strong> means you will waste time building relationships with people you never should have had a relationship with.</p>

<p>Even worse, if you realize they are not good for your life <strong>deep</strong> into the relationship, the process of “defriending” them can be insanely awkward and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>On the other hand, being too focused on <strong>pickiness</strong> means you will end up with a long list of acquaintances, but no strong social connections.</p>

<p>No one to talk to when things are tough, no one to invite to your birthday party, etc.</p>

<h2 id="now-that-the-puzzle-is-clear---what-do-we-do-about-it">Now that the puzzle is clear - what do we do about it?</h2>

<p>You must get FASTER at knowing when a group or a person are worth committing to.</p>

<p>This comes with experience.</p>

<p>If you are an <strong>inexperienced</strong> friend maker, it might take 30 shared experiences with a group before you realize “these aren’t my people”.</p>

<p><strong>With</strong> experience, you’ll learn to read people better, and pick up on subtle clues that quickly nudge you in one direction or the other.</p>

<p>Think back to people who you thought might be friends, but fizzled out. What were the earlier clues it would go that way?</p>

<p>Think about the same thing for your best friends. What are the things that make them your friends, and were you able to see them coming?</p>

<p>This is one of the tough parts about friend making.</p>

<p>If you are lucky, you strike gold right away. But for most people, you’ll have to go through a few different cycles before you find someone you want to be close friends with.</p>
