# More responsibility = More discipline	

**TL:DR: When you add more external responsibility you have in your life, you magically attain more discipline and determination**  

As a teen, I pursed lofty goals.

Goals that depended on putting in consistent work over a long period of time.

Example:

* Become an internet marketer = spend 40 hours a week on trying to make $1 online. Do this for 3 months. 

Or 

* Build cool personal projects = spend 10 hours every weekend on development. Do this for 12 months.

Unfortunately - from the ages 15 - 18 I found doing the above **impossible**.

I simply didn't have the discipline to stick to these commitments - even though I KNEW the reward would be great.

I read books, I listened to podcasts, I tried cold showers...

But at the end of the day, I just didn't have the discipline. 

-

Since then, I've seen the same issue come up in other precocious teens. 

They have ambition, but **rarely** actually do the hard things required.

So what changed for me?

What was the secret sauce that gave me this discipline?

**Responsibility.**

When I started working real jobs, with REAL consequences, I found I ***magically*** had discipline.

If I knew that my boss was going to be disappointed with me, 

or that other people were relying on me,

or that my career might be at stake ,

I SUDDENLY found I had ***wells*** of discipline to pull from.

I could work long days, I could push through resistance, I could stick to tough things.

**And here's the surprising part:**

That discipline started to spread to other areas of my life;

EVEN if there was no boss to be dissapointed with me, and no coworkers relying on me.

By "learning" what being disciplined felt like, I was able to use it more and more on my personal projects.

The more responsibility I took on, the more discipline I gained.
